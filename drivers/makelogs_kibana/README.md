# Driver: makelogs_kibana
This driver simulates Kibana queries against data generated by the *rankin_makelogs* driver.

## Operations
The driver supports the following 3 operations:

### dashboard1
This operation retrieves data for Dashboard1 based on the configured parameters. This contains 8 visualisations (including one tile map) and looks like this:

![
](./dashboard_images/dashboard1.png)

### dashboard2
This operation retrieves data for Dashboard2 based on the configured parameters. This contains 6 visualisations and a search panel and looks like this:

](./dashboard_images/dashboard2.png)

### dashboard3
This operation retrieves data for Dashboard3 based on the configured parameters. This contains 7 visualisations and a search panel and looks like this:

](./dashboard_images/dashboard3.png)

## Parameters
The following parameters can be used to configure the data generation process of the makelogs driver:

Parameter | Description
:------------ | :------------
**index** | Index or alias the Kibana queries should be directed at. Defaults to 'rankin*'.
**days** | Date or date interval the current date will be randomized from. This can be specified in 3 formats: 1) Absolute single date, e.g. *"2015-04-20"* 2) Absolute date range, e.g. *"2015-04-20,2015-04-26"* 3) Date range relative to current date/time, e.g. *"-7,3"*. Defaults to *"-1,0"*.
**period** | Length of the period in days that the Kiana queries will address. Defaults to 30.
**text_filter_file** | Path to file containing terms used to filter the 'text' field. If no file is provided, the default behaviour is that no filtering on the 'text' field will occur.

## Example Configuration File
Below is a sample configuration file that shows how the driver can be invoked. 

This example switches between all three dashboards according to the weights at a rate of 1 request per 5 seconds using a single worker.
